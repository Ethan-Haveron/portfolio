              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p class="info-para">Having an online presence is importing within the industry. Having your own personal
                 identity is nothing but beneficial, the task for me was to create my own personal brand and a little spot for me
                 on the internet (aka make a website).

                 <h3>Monogram</h3>
              <p class="info-para">Coming up with a monogram was difficult for me because of my initials EH as the majority of the ideas I had in my head someone else already made them.
                  This lead me down a long road of idea generation for me to come up with my final completed monogram..</p>

                   <h3>Visual marque</h3>
             <p class="info-para">"I like to always think ahead and always be one step ahead of the game."
                Using this sentence alone allowed me to come up with an idea of a visual mark that suites me and also look clean and nice to look at.</p>

                  <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
              <p class="info-para">This was a difficult and time-consuming project but a well-needed one.
                 I know that having my own identity will greatly help down the line as it is a way of people to
                 remember me and a way for me to advertise myself.</p>

          <p>These where my two main ideas for my monogram I chose these two due to them being so different.
             One being very typographical and the other being more like some sort of illustrated piece of work.</p>

              <p>I liked how simple the first monogram was, just a slight angle on the letters that stayed consistent
                 with each vertical area. As you can see I have made my monogram in different colours. this was just to give me
                  a representation and example of what colours I could use and what looked best with his monogram.</p>

                </div>



       <div class="col-50-right">


          <p>This is the more illustrated monogram that I made. I was swayed towards this one more as I like
            the square box shape it gave. I also spend a very long time playing around with the spacing and the width of
             my lines to the point where some changes were so small you had to look right up close to really see them. but hey, I wanted it to look perfect.</p>

             <p>Like the last one, I tried it with many different colours to see what best suited. I also used the colours to
                help me find why my monograms didn't look correct, as the colours acted as a filter and allowed me to see different parts that needed fixing.</p>
