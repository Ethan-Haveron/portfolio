              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p class="info-para">The majority of wallpapers that come stock on phones and computers are boring
                 to say the least, and some that you can download is even worse.  My task was to create minimal wallpapers that don't look sh*t.
</p>

            </div>

               <div class="col">
                 <h3>My Idea</h3>
              <p class="info-para">I wanted to make my wallpapers as simple as possible, so I decided I was just going to use simple shapes.
                I personally don't like a busy wallpaper because the majority of files and apps are on peoples home page.
I               was just going to make the main element to sit in the centre of the screen allowing as much space as possible for the important things.</p>

               </div>

                <div class="col">
                   <h3>Limitations</h3>
             <p class="info-para"> I didn't want to be using shape builders and the Pathfinder tools every single time because it feels
                like I'm not sticking to my plan of using simples shapes. so it was difficult to come up with ideas that fitted my original plan.</p>

                 <div class="col">
                  <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
              <p class="info-para">This project was overall beneficial as it made me look at my work and other people work in a different
                 light, showing me how every complex design can be broken down into different shapes.</p>

        <div class="col-50-left">

          <p>As you can tell I chose to pick ice lollies as my wallpaper. I did some research on single element wallpapers/screensavers and thought it would be a good idea to make an ice lolly. I tried to made it look as simple as possible as like a previously busy background images make it harder to look at the screen for long periods of time.</p>

        </div>


       <div class="col-50-right">


          <p>After I made the lolly I could easily just change the colour of the lolly itself and the background colour which allowed people to have the option to choose what one they wanted.
            I also put the wallpaper on an iPhone mock-up just to see what it would look like before I download it and put it on an actual phone.</p>
