              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p class="info-para">I've always found 3D design incredible and I have always
                 wanted to broaden my design skill so over summer I started a side project to
                learn 3d design in a software called Blender.</p>

            </div>

               <div class="col">
                 <h3>How I learned</h3>
              <p class="info-para">I learned the basics of 3d from following a few tutorials using Youtube.
                I followed quick intense tutorials so I could learn
                 as quickly as possible. Then after knowing the basics, I could design my own "stuff" (my own simple stuff).</P>
               </div>

                <div class="col">
                   <h3>Project Time Frame</h3>
             <p class="info-para">I didn't have an exact time frame as since I was learning a new skill I could get
                it straight away or it could take me longer.
                My time frames were basically, learn as much as possible over the whole of summer (so summer is my time frame).</p>

                 <div class="col">
                  <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
              <p class="info-para">Learning 3D is no easy task it takes a lot of time to master (which I am nowhere near)
                and can get easily confusing working with the 3 dimensions.
                Learning the shortcuts may be one of the best pieces of advice I could
                give to anyone. It makes your designing so much faster.</p>

          <p>The low poly design is the style that I decided to create over the course of summer as it was simpler and easier to learn, plus the style alone just looks really nice.
it's so easy to put loads of detail into something and it comes out looking bad in the end. my way of thinking was to get the shapes and modelling down before learning the tiny little detail things.</p>
        </div>


       <div class="col-50-right">


          <p>As I got more familiar with blender and could model faster I decided to try some slighter harder things such as the two towers that you can see above.
             I had to learn many different techniques to make the top of the tower and had to learn more lighting techniques to get the final outcome.</p>
